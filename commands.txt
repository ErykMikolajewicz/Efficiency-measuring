# Commands I used during test, to ensure resembling execution times

# Count number of running processes
sudo ps -e | wc -l
# Around 300 in GUI mode, and 260 in text mode
# Switching to text mode don't change a lot

# Command ensure only one cpu core will be used
taskset -c 0 pdm run src/measurement.py  --option
# Best results, but still very various execution times

# Plan something on real time fifo, with high priority
sudo chrt -f 99 /home/eryk/.local/bin/pdm run src/measurement.py  --cpu 1
# Disappointing result, use only 95% of core, and frequently interrupt process execution,
# results still very floating
